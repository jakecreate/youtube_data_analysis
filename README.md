# **YouTube Channel Analysis: Outdoor Boys**  

## **üìå Project Overview**  
This project analyzes the **Outdoor Boys YouTube channel (Luke Nichols)** to uncover trends in upload frequency, video duration, and engagement metrics. Data was collected and processed using the **YouTube API** to explore patterns in video performance and audience interaction.  

**Key Findings**
- Luke's upload frequency peaked in 2019, with a subsequent rise in 2024.
- Video durations have gradually increased throughout the years.
- Each year, almost all of his videos were uploaded on Saturdays.
- In 2024
    - There was a notable drop in average video
    - Furthermore, Luke started to have a significantly wider variation in the duration of his uploads.
    - Content strategy changed with "Youtube Shorts" (videos 60 seconds or below) being uploaded throughout the week, also explaining the notable drop in average duration + wider variation of duration that year.
- About one in every 52 viewers who clicked on his videos hit the like button.
- Each year contains videos high-performing videos (outliers based on likes each year), likely driving his regular performing video to grow exponentially in likes over time.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries**
